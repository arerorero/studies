Here I will take notes about my commits, I know it's named "readme", but you dont really need to read me :), but be free 🐝

1st - On my first commit I published what I have been doing for 3 or 4 days, I actually cannot remember. I just started learning HTML and CSS. For some reason I was reluctant and did not started with this as my first code experiênce.
